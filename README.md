# Feed The Good

Hello, my name is Billy and this is a public repository of links to good things. In other words, links to positive, mindful, and inspirational websites, products, and services. While I believe being blindly or overly positive can have negative effects, being positive and mindful often makes me feel better. It’s okay to be sad sometimes, but if one wallows in negativity 24/7 things aren’t going to go well.

To use this repository simply search at https://feedthegood.github.io/home. I hope something here makes you smile.

Also, feel free to post something in the discussions area: https://github.com/feedthegood/home/discussions

Here’s to happiness and love,

Billy
